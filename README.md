H-index is one of the metrics to evaluate the impact of a researcher in academia. It's suggested in 2005 by Jorge E. Hirsch, a physicist at UCSD. H-index author-level metric that attempts to measure both the productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar. For example, if a researcher's h-index is 6, he has 6 papers that have been cited at least 6 times.
